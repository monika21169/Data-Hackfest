## Introduction
PayParityQuest is a website that helps you get paid fairly for your work, regardless of gender.

PayParityQuest is a comprehensive platform that provides tools and resources to help people negotiate their salaries, find jobs that match their skills and experience, and achieve their career goals.

## Features
PayParityQuest is a website that helps you get paid fairly for your work. It has two main features:

**Customized negotiation email:** This feature helps you create a persuasive email to send to your manager when negotiating your salary or promotion. You simply need to upload your resume and a draft of your own negotiation email, and PayParityQuest will provide feedback and suggestions.

**Job search with filters:** This feature allows you to find jobs based on your skills, gender, experience, and other criteria. You can also filter results by salary, location, and company type.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): This is typically included with Node.js installation.
- git

### Job page setup

1. You don't need to clone the repo again, you already have the repo on your local device.

2. Navigate to the Jobs folder:

```bash
cd Data-Hackfest/Jobs
```

Since the project has two main components, make sure that you're running the commands in the right order because you'll only be able to access the Jobs section on the main website after you have run the Job page.
